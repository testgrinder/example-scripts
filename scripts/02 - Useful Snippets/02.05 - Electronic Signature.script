Scenario: Interact with Electronic Signature dialog

     Then I see the 'Electronic Signature Authentication' dialog
      And I enter the password for the User role in the 'Password' field
      And I enter 'testgrinder test' in the 'Reason For Change' field
      And I click the OK button
      And I see the flash message 'Record has been saved'
