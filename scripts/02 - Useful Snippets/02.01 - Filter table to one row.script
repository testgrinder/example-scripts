In this example, the Assets table is filtered to one row with 1001 in the Asset column.
It ensures that exactly one row is found, and the clicks on the row to choose it.

     When I enter '=1001' in the 'Asset' filter in the 'Assets' table
      And I initiate search in the 'Assets' table
     Then I see exactly 1 row in the 'Assets' table
      And I see the value '1001' in the 'Asset' field on the current row in the 'Assets' table
      And I choose the first row in the 'Assets' table
